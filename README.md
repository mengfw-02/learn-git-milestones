## Git Basics


### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

- It has a [simple syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) similar to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example)
- The standard language for formatting README files (what you are currently viewing!)
- Markdown files use the `.md` extension and can be edited with a simple text editor.
- Can be previewed using the [Markdown Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk/related?hl=en) browser extension. (hint: allow `file://` origins)

Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output
--- | --- | ---
`[link](https://davidson.edu)` | `<a href="https://davidson.edu">link</a>` | [link](https://davidson.edu)
`**bold text**` | `<b>bold text</b>` | **bold text**
`*italicized text*` | `<i>italicized text</i>` | *italicized text*
<code>\`code`</code> | `<code>code</code>` | `code`
`![text](assets/img/icon.png)` | `<img alt="text" src="assets/img/icon.png">` | ![text](assets/img/icon.png)

**Now you know basic Markdown!** üéâ  The following instructions will help you learn Git, editing this `.md` file in the process. Feel free to check your syntax in the [github markdown cheatsheet](reference-sheets/github-markdown-cheatsheet.pdf).




### Fork this repository
Create a Github account and make your first commit

- [x] [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
- [x] Fork this [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repository (click the Fork button, top right).
- [x] ‚úèÔ∏è Edit the README file (click the pencil icon) and add your favorite emoji here: **üòÇ**
- [x] ‚úèÔ∏è Edit the space between the square brackets `[ ]` preceding each line you complete to look like `[x]`
- [x] ‚úèÔ∏è Commit changes to README.md to the main branch with the message `commit #1 from Github.com`
- [x] View the commit history and confirm your edits


### Git Installation
Install your development environment

- [ ] Complete the [command line crash course](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics-command-line.md#crash-course)
- [ ] Install Git on your machine ([via](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03))

**Windows** Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (includes [Git BASH](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash), its own version of the bash shell)

**Mac**
1. Install the [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) (confirm "yes" if asked to install *Command Line Developer Tools*)
1. Install git using Homebrew `brew install git` (unless you are [upgrading](https://ajahne.github.io/blog/tools/2018/06/11/how-to-upgrade-git-mac.html)?)
<!-- 1. Set your default shell to bash `chsh -s /bin/bash` - You'll be prompted to type a password. The command line doesn't give you feedback that you're typing. Just type your password and hit enter. Backspace a lot if you make a mistake. -->

### Configure Git

- [ ] On the command line, confirm Git is installed by typing `git` at the prompt and hitting enter
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è This displays a help file with a list of possible commands. What does `log` do? *****
- [ ] Add your name and email (replace with your information and press return after each line)
```bash
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```
- [ ] Set the default branch to [main](https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main)
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
- [ ] Confirm your settings worked with either of these
```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
git config --list
```



## Basic Git workflows
You should be able to perform a basic Git workflow using Github.com, the command line, Github Desktop, and Git in a preferred text editor (e.g. Atom or Visual Studio). These four different interfaces will give you practice and help you understand Git better. You've already forked and made a commit on Github.com so let's move to Github Desktop ...


### In Github Desktop
You should be able to ...

- [ ] Install [Atom](https://atom.io/) on your machine
	- [ ] Connect your Github account in Atom
- [ ] Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
	- [ ] Connect your Github account in Github Desktop
	- [ ] In Github Desktop, clone the fork (you made above) [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) ...
	- [ ] File > Clone Repository > Github.com and select it ...
	- [ ] Local Path: Click "Choose" and add a new folder on your computer. This will be the base folder for your work in this class: `<your-class-name-here>`
	- [ ] Click "Clone" to make a local copy
- [ ] Open the repo in Atom: Repository > Open in Atom  
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è In Atom, edit this README file and add your *second* favorite emoji here: **üôå**
- [ ] In Github Desktop, view/confirm your edits to the README file on the Changes tab
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Commit your changes directly to the main branch with the message `commit #2 from Github Desktop`
- [ ] Click Push origin to push your new commit to remote repo  
- [ ] Confirm the changes to the README file were pushed: Choose Repository > View on Github
- [ ] Click on the README file and then click on History to see the history of this file


### Command line interface (CLI)
You should have a basic familiarity with the command line to install Git. Some folks use the CLI as their default tool for editing and publishing source code, but Atom makes it much easier.

- [ ] If you haven't yet, complete the [command line crash course](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics-command-line.md#crash-course)
- [ ] In Github Desktop, with the [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) repo you cloned above selected, click Repository > Open in Terminal ("Bash" in Windows?)
- [ ] Use the CLI to navigate directories  
  - [ ] List files in this directory: `ls`
  - [ ] List files in this directory, including hidden: `ls -la`  
  - [ ] Confirm the existence of the `.git` directory (where Git versions and config are stored)
  - [ ] View your current directory and copy the full path: `pwd`
  - [ ] Open this README file in Atom and paste that path here: **/Users/mengfanwang/Sites/critical-web-design/learn-git-milestones/README.md**
- [ ] Use Git on the CLI
  - [ ] [Confirm](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) your name and email is correct in the Git config
  - [ ] View the status of your repo: `git status`
  - [ ] View the changed files of your repo: `git diff`
  - [ ] Add all changed files to the staging area `git add .`
  - [ ] View the status of your repo `git status` to confirm it has been staged
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Commit your changes with the message `commit #3 from CLI`
  - [ ] Use `git push` to [push those changes to your remote repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)



You've used most of these already through a GUI (e.g. `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) ...




### Git in Atom
You should be able to ...

- [ ] In Github Desktop, open this repo [learn-git-milestones](https://github.com/omundy/learn-git-milestones) in Atom: Repository > Open in Atom  
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è In Atom, edit this README file and add your *third* favorite emoji here: **ü•±**
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Create a new file `hello.txt`, add some text and save it.
- [ ] Display the Git panel (click the small Git button at the bottom right).

![atom-git-menu](assets/img/atom-git-menu.png)

- [ ] Select on your file(s) in Unstaged changes and confirm your changes match what you expect to see
- [ ] Double click on each file with changes to stage them  
- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Commit your changes directly to the main branch with the message `commit #4 from Atom`




## Create a new repository

- [ ] Create a repository from scratch
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è In Github Desktop, create a new repository with the name: `my-awesome-project`
  - [ ] Local Path: Click "Choose" and create a new folder `my-awesome-project` inside the `<your-class-name-here>` folder you made above
  - [ ] Click Create Repository
  - [ ] This should now be your class folder's directory structure.
  ```
  <your-class-name-here>
    |-- my-awesome-project
    |-- learn-git-milestones
  ```
  - [ ] Open your new repository in Atom (with Github Desktop or drag the `my-awesome-project` project folder onto the Atom icon in your dock)
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Add a README file: `README.md`
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è In the README write your name and the date
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Use some [Markdown tags](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)




## Create a Github.io page
Create a github.io site for your repository ...

- [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Create a file called `index.html` in your new repo and add the following html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My first github.io website</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>üôå</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- [ ] Set up a [Github page](https://pages.github.com/) "project site" for your repo
  - [ ] On Github.com, go to your repo > Settings, and scroll down to the Github Pages section
  - [ ] Select the main branch source and click save
  - [ ] Do not use a theme. Start from scratch
  - [ ] Visit your project site at http://*username*.github.io/my-awesome-project
  - [ ] Update your project, push a new commit, and confirm your updates (note: [changes are not always instant](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-a1/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages))
  - [ ] ‚úèÔ∏è Paste this link here:






## Turn in this Assignment
Now that we have basic Git commands out of the way use Git to create and turn in your assignment ...

- [ ] Complete all of the items on this README
- [ ] Test your file(s) in a web browser
- [ ] Commit and push the files to Github
- [ ] Paste the github.io link into the appropriate Moodle forum
